# Community Detection on Graphs with Multiple Layered Community Structures
This project focuses on the community structure analysis on graphs with multiple layers of community structures embedded in it. To conduct experiments on multiple layers of community structures in the graph, graphs that are based on the same nodes but wired with different edges are merged. Then the merged graph is analyzed by different techniques - such as community detection algorithms, overlapping community detection algorithms, nested community detection algorithms - to recover information about community structures set in the merged graph.
